	<h1>Testicular Cancer</h1>

	<div>
	<p>The symptoms of testicular cancer include:
		<br> -Lumps or bumps in the testes that weren't there before
		<br> -Pain in the testes or the lower abdomen
		<br> -Feeling of "heaviness" in the scrotum
		<br> -Breast/Chest enlargement
		<br> -Lower back pain
		<br>
		<br> If the cancer spreads along the lymph nodes, it can cause symptoms like: 
		<br> -Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
		<br> -A lump in the neck
	</p>
	<p> These symptoms can be scary and painful, which is why it is so important to keep track of your reproductive health.
		<br> Treatments for testicular cancer include orchiectomy (removal of the testicle(s)), chemotherapy, and radiation.
