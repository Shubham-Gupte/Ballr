<p> ball'r believes that the male reproductive system is important- who doesn't? 
	<br> That's why ball'r helps you stay responsible of your reproductive system
	<br> by keeping track of the temperature of your scrotum. 
	<br> Happy balls equals happy all, and ball'r will not only tell you the 
	<br> current temperature of your testes, but it will also show you the trends
	<br> and tendencies of your body. Everyone's balls are different- ball'r understands that.
