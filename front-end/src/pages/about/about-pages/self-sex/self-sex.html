	<h1>Self-Sex</h1>
	<p>Yes! Masturbation! Masturbation is healthy (in moderation; don't go <i>too</i> crazy) and can help prevent prostate cancer! 
		<br> It can also prevent muscle tone loss as you age, and causes increased levels of cortisone, which helps boost your immune system! 
		<br> As long as your habits don't interfere with your sex life or social life (or your life in general,) it is a healthy habit to keep up!
