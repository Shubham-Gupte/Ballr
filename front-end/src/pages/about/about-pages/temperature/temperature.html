	<h1>Temperature and Your Testicles</h1>
	<p>The average male's testicles should be about 2.5&deg;C to 3&deg;C lower than the average body temperature (37&deg;C).
		<br>While scrotal temperature can increase because of reasons like a fever, it has been shown that scrotal temperature was higher than average in men with testicular cancer or extranodal non-Hodgkins lymphoma located in the testes.
		<br>However: Don't worry if you get hot when you exercise! The heat produced by your body during exercise does not cause infertility, nor does it mean that you have testicular cancer or lymphoma. Just be worried when you have irregular "data" like differences in temperature or unusual lumps and bumps. </p>
