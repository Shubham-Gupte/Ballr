	<h1>Fertility</h1>

	<div>
		<p>Male fertility can be influenced by scrotal temperature; since spermatogenesis is most efficient at 34&deg;C, the testicles should remain at around that temperature, which is about 2.5&deg;C to 3&deg;C lower than average body temperature (37&deg;C). If the scrotal temperature is higher than the recommended range, spermatocide can occur. There are people with a condition that causes their testicles to rest inside of their bodies; this means that spermatogenesis cannot occur, and they are rendered infertile. If higher scrotal temperature is prolonged, this can result in the formation of abnormally-shaped sperm, and a decreased sperm count.
			<br>Don't worry about exercise though- that won't affect your sperm count much!</p>
