	<h1>Self-Check</h1>
	<p> As the great Deadpool said during his movie campaign, "Gentlemen, Touch Yourself Tonight!"
		<br> Performing a self-exam on yourself at least once a month is extremely important! It is more likely that you or your partner will find any irregularities in your testicles, rather than a physician, because you and your partner are the ones who know best what is normal and what is not normal!</p>
