	<h1>Lymphoma and Testicular Lymphoma</h1>

	<div>
		<h2>What is Lymphoma?</h2>
		<p> Lymphoma is the name for a group of cancers that form when a blood cell (lymphocyte) becomes malignant. 
			<br>Testicular lymphoma is extranodal, meaning that it is outside of the lymph nodes.
			</p>
		<h2>What does that have to do with my balls?</h2>
			<p>It was found that Doppler flow, or the flow of blood through the vessel measured by ultrasound, to the testes was increased in men with testicular cancer and lymphoma; this means that men with these diseases were found to have higher scrotal temperatures that the average male.
